          <br><h3>Description</h3>
          <p>In psycholinguistic research, large databases of words, such as the English Lexicon Project, the CELEX lexical database, and the MRC psycholinguistic database, have been essential resources for researchers who require data for a multitude of lexical characteristics. These databases typically consist of a comprehensive set of words and their corresponding lexical properties (e.g., word length, number of syllables, pronunciation, etc.), which allow researchers to generate stimuli selection for experimental design (e.g., selecting words that vary on some dimension while matched on others).</p>

<p>However, even though many of these databases are comprehensive and have been made widely available, they are associated with methodological limitations. Most critically, researchers are not able to obtain data for stimuli that are not present in these databases, such as less common words, or stimuli that do not form actual words. For example, in lexical decision paradigms, wherein participants are required to distinguish between actual words and made-up words (e.g., ‘murp’), nonwords are necessary as part of the experimental stimuli. Some researchers are also interested in creating specific stimuli, such as pseudohomophones (e.g., ‘brane’) and illegal nonwords (e.g., ‘btese’), to examine the mechanisms underlying word recognition. These types of stimuli are not typically represented in existing databases, and thus, manipulating and controlling for the lexical characteristics of these stimuli can be difficult without some programming expertise.</p>  

      <p>To improve on current methods, this project introduces LexiCAL (<em>lexi</em>cal <em>cal</em>culator), a standalone executable program that serves as a calculator for a wide range of lexical variables. LexiCAL provides options for users to calculate surface, orthographic, phonological, and phonographic metrics, using inbuilt algorithms. The range of metrics that LexiCAL can compute have been shown to be theoretically important predictors of both visual and spoken word recognition. Importantly, LexiCAL offers users the flexibility of performing calculations for any user-specified input, with reference to any user-specified corpus and phonetic system. Since the algorithms in LexiCAL are generic, LexiCAL allows users to compute metrics for any letter string (both words and nonwords) in any language with an alphabetic script. With a simple and intuitive user interface, LexiCAL provides maximum functionality and useability.</p>

      LexiCAL was developed using Python.
<br>
      <br><h3>User Interface</h3>
      The image below shows the main window of the application.
      <img src="assets/img/lexical.tif" class="img-fluid mb-4">

      <p>LexiCAL is available only for the 64-bit version of the Windows operating system, and is not compatible with the 32-bit version of Windows, nor the macOS or Linux operating systems. The program is a standalone executable (LexiCAL.exe) that does not require any installation to launch.</p>
      
      <p>LexiCAL computes and returns the output for each target word in the user-specified input (the input file), based on the user-specified corpus (the corpus file) and phonetic system.</p>

      <br><h3>Type of Metrics</h3>

      <br><h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>LexiCAL is a simple and intuitive application that improves on existing resources by offering researchers the flexibility of computing lexical variables for any stimuli with respect to any corpus of text, using any phonetic system (if applicable). Notably, the lexical variables that LexiCAL can compute include a broad range of inbuilt surface, orthographic, phonological, and phonographic metrics. From a methodological perspective, the program is a useful tool for
researchers interested in calculating the lexical properties for any stimuli (both words and nonwords) with reference to any corpus, and should hopefully serve as a resource for experimental design, data analyses, and/or database creation.</p>
